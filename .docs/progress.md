# Log

## Data

### 2026-09-12 — repo mapped onto the fixed project structure
`.docs/` (progress, figures, latex-draft, runs), `slurm/`, `outputs/` for
runs, `config-global.json` + `scripts/dm_link.py` replacing
`link_data.sh`; `PROJECT.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` merged into this file.

### 2026-09-12 — synthetic pool complete
Groups 02-11: 304,930 records in 601 shards (tokens done, syncing to
Helma); group 12: 75,342 records in 156 shards (tokens computing). With
group 01 (10,101) the pool is 390,373 records, 85x the Waymo train count.
Body models, group 01 and all real shards (85 GB) already on Helma.

### 2026-09-10 10:46 — BEDLAM frames without depth are skipped (dc8a628)
`BedlamFramesSource` indexes only frames whose png and depth exist
(`incomplete` counter); the notebook failed on the group whose extraction
was still running. 1 test.

### 2026-09-10 09:16 — fixes found at scale (1429370)
Per-frame mask lookup ignored the group; SLOPER4D seq009 stores 4 values
per 2D joint; bash `GROUPS` is reserved. Waymo shards: 4,591 train / 894
val records; SLOPER4D train 21,062 records.

### 2026-09-10 03:28 — real shards, shard dataset, SAM 3 masks, tokens (b3bf5eb)
`scripts/sam3_waymo_masks.py` (5,560 Waymo crops, verified visually),
`generate/real.py`, `data/shards.py` (`ShardDataset`: scan-variant
selection, precomputed tokens, point augmentation),
`scripts/precompute_tokens.py` (frozen ViT-H tokens, fp16).

### 2026-09-10 03:19 — synthetic shard generator (926e3a5)
`generate/records.py` (fixed-shape records, npz shards with named scan
variants), `lidar/placement.py` (ball placement, rig poses),
`lidar/distance.py` (virtual distance by moving the camera back with
z-buffer re-rendering; the first attempt scaled the scene, which keeps
angles and was wrong), `generate/synth.py` (8 scan variants per frame,
visibility rule 90x35 px + 30 returns, augmented copy, distance
augmentation on 30 % of frames), multiprocess CLI. 5 tests.

### 2026-09-10 03:10 — BEDLAM SMPL labels attached (d54a96a)
`data/bedlam_labels.py`: translation = `trans_cam + cam_ext[:3,3]`
(verified: 85 % of vertices inside the masks); silhouette-overlap matching
(98 % of labels matched). Extraction queue for the 11 remaining groups.

### 2026-09-10 00:55 — sensor rigs and rolling shutter (d46f545)
`rigs/`: Waymo, nuScenes, SLOPER4D, AVA, FUSE-Bike loaders, plotly
figures, exports (PNG, HTML, GLB, tree) into `figures/rigs/`;
`lidar/motion.py`: `SpeedSetting` (10 km/h steps, Waymo preset 20 +- 20
km/h) and `apply_rolling_shutter`.

### 2026-09-09 22:35 — augmentations (e42366f)
`lidar/augment.py` (cover, channel dropout, jitter, outliers,
miscalibration), `data/image_augment.py` (erasing, cover, colour, blur,
JPEG, bbox jitter); notebook section with the 4x3 resolution grid.

### 2026-09-09 17:42 — Ouster presets (70fdc89)
OS0/OS1/OS2 families by channels x steps per revolution; `azimuth_window`
maps the camera HFOV to scan columns.

### 2026-09-09 10:32 — LiDAR simulator (67b3a2f)
Ray marching against the BEDLAM depth, sensor offsets, noise, dropout,
occlusion augmentation. SMPL labels located on the project server
(42a917c).

### 2026-09-08 18:26 — data pipeline (2c8706c)
Loaders for SLOPER4D, LiDARHuman26M, Waymo (pose_complete_4) and BEDLAM
raw frames on one camera-frame schema; torch dataset; losses; metrics; 21
tests. BEDLAM v1 verified complete (390 archives, 6.54 TB, planar z-depth
in cm); BEDLAM 2.0 skipped.

## Model

### 2026-09-12 — loader was the bottleneck: memory-mapped shards (f83d95d)
First batch tests on Helma: 360-390 samples/s at batch 256 and 512 with
only 2.3 / 4.0 GiB peak per GPU, i.e. the GPUs waited for data. Cause:
`np.load` on an npz re-reads a whole member (96 MB image stack) on every
row access. `Shard` now maps the uncompressed members in place (zip local
headers parsed, `np.ndarray` views on one memmap), rows are copied only
where they become tensors; 28 ms/sample warm, 1 test. Jobs now use 64
CPUs, 16 workers per rank and stage only the needed shard directories to
node-local `/tmp` (`STAGE_DIRS`). Round 2 of the tests: `batchtest2-b<N>`.
First test also validated the whole chain: eval, `best.pt`, `DONE`, wandb
sync from the login node (run visible in wandb).

### 2026-09-12 — batch-size scaling tests submitted on Helma (1bba8d2, 7fdeb54)
`configs/batchtest.yaml` (80/10/10 mixture on group 01 + real shards,
600 steps) at batch 256 / 512 / 1024 / 2048, 1 h each, h100 partition,
run names `batchtest-b<N>`; trainer logs samples/s and peak GPU memory;
wandb login on the Helma login node with `slurm/wandb_sync_loop.sh`
detached there. Requested runs afterwards: `configs/mix80.yaml` (80 %
BEDLAM, 10 % SLOPER4D, 10 % Waymo) and `configs/synth_only.yaml` (100 %
BEDLAM) at the largest batch that fits.

### 2026-09-10 09:41 — training stack (5e51d6f)
`train/config.py` (YAML + overrides, `${DATA_ROOT}`), `train/sampler.py`
(fixed per-batch mixture, DDP-sharded), `train/loop.py` (torchrun DDP,
AdamW + warm-up/cosine, bf16, eval every N steps, `last.pt`/`best.pt`,
auto-resume, SIGUSR1 checkpoint-and-exit, `DONE`, offline wandb),
`metrics/protocol.py`, gate modes `learned|none|hard|image_only|lidar_only`,
IoU-confidence head, `main.py`, `evaluate.py`, 16 configs,
`slurm/train.sbatch` (self-resubmitting), `slurm/wandb_sync.sh`. SMPL heads
forced to float32 under autocast. Smoke run: 40 steps on the 4090. 5 tests
(68 total). Helma: `/anvme` and `$WORK` not on compute nodes,
`/hnvme/workspace` is (`cluster.md`).

### 2026-09-09 11:13 — selective-attention fusion model (8846d44)
ViT with TokenHMR ViT-H weights (0 missing keys), point tokenizer, gated
dual cross-attention decoder with routing priors, SMPL heads (6D
rotations, translation via crop intrinsics), differentiable SMPL, 3D box;
`debug/capabilities.ipynb`.

## Experiments

### 2026-09-10 02:44 — plan and ablations decided (30c4b90, d46f545)
Waymo headline, SLOPER4D secondary, LiDARHuman26M and PedX dropped;
`plan.md`, `ablations.md` (ball-radius sweep, resolution ablation, rolling
shutter kept as a generation option only).

## Paper

### 2026-09-11 13:38 — related work and bibliography (72af389, fc8943a, 0e3d746)
39 bib entries with venue macros from `latex-draft/bib/bib-short.def`;
related-work bullets; LIF-Net (IV 2026) and BikeActions (ICPR 2026)
official citations. Self-contained build: style files beside `main.tex`
and a `latexmkrc` (8445f2e).

### 2026-09-10 18:10 — contributions and story (3df2902, 41192fa, 09070d4, df39884)
`story.md` (claim, model / data / synthesis ladders, run order); three
contribution bullets; 6.3 extrinsics questions.

## Housekeeping

### 2026-09-08 18:08 — scaffold (c9beeab)
uv, hatchling, ruff, mypy strict; five baseline submodules; BEDLAM audit;
dataset survey.

# Todos

## Data

- [ ] Tokens for group 12, then rsync groups 02-12 to Helma (`/hnvme/workspace/v103fe17-lidar-bedlam/data/generated`), running.
- [ ] Dataset statistics for the paper (persons, frames, distance histogram, beams, occlusion levels) and the comparison table.
- [ ] Run the official xxh128 validation on the NAS (`scripts/validate_bedlam_on_nas.sh`).
- [ ] Rolling shutter: apply `SpeedSetting` + `apply_rolling_shutter` in the generator (default speed 0 for v1).
- [ ] Decide on additional rigs (heads-up list in `datasets.md`).
- [ ] Waymo LiDAR-only samples (5,006) as `has_image=False` records (after the main run).

## Model

- [ ] Batch tests running; then launch `mix80` and `synth_only` at the largest batch, then `main_mixed`, on Helma once the sync is complete (`sbatch --export=ALL,CONFIG=configs/main_mixed.yaml slurm/train.sbatch`); verify the resume chain at the first wall-time hit; sync wandb from the login node.
- [ ] SMPL mesh overlays in the BEDLAM cells of `debug/capabilities.ipynb`.
- [ ] After hand-in: DINOv2 ViT-S distillation for the Jetson AGX Orin (bicycle rig), ONNX/TensorRT.

## Experiments

- [ ] Main table: `synth_only`, `real_only`, `main_mixed` on Waymo val and SLOPER4D test.
- [ ] Model axis: `ablation_image_only`, `ablation_gate_none`, `ablation_gate_hard`, `ablation_lidar_only` vs `ablation_mixed_short`.
- [ ] Synthesis axis: `ablation_ball025`, `ablation_rig_waymo`, `ablation_target_waymo`; log validation curves for the convergence question.
- [ ] Data curve: `ablation_scale_{2,4,8,16,32}x`.
- [ ] Baseline runners for TokenHMR, CameraHMR, LiDAR-HMR (checkpoint arrives on the NAS), SAM 3D Body (MHR to joints).
- [ ] After hand-in: realism ablations (no augmentation, no occlusion), LoRA on the backbone.

## Paper

- [ ] Data section (BEDLAM inputs, LiDAR simulation, realism, statistics).
- [ ] Method section (backbones, gates, outputs incl. translation through given intrinsics, losses).
- [ ] Results and ablation tables from the runs; gate-map figure.
- [ ] Anonymity pass: no rig, group or first-person names.

## Housekeeping

- [ ] Rotate the BEDLAM password and remove it from the shared NAS `be_download.sh`.
- [ ] Complete the Human-M3 download and the remaining 9 SLOPER4D sequences.
- [ ] Fix dangling symlinks in `publicdatasets/LiDARHuman26M`; consider deleting 1.4 TB of redundant Waymo tarballs.
